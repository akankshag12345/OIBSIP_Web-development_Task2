            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century saint Ramakrishna. 
                He was a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. 
                Vivekananda is best known for his speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893, 
                which began with the iconic words, "Sisters and brothers of America...". 
                He inspired generations to value education, discipline, and unity through his spiritual and nationalistic messages.
